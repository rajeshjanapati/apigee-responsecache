Feature:
  As an Apigee platform explorer
  I want to experiment with the JWT policy
  So that I can understand how it can be implemented
  
  Scenario Outline: Generate Signed JWT
    When I POST to /generate-signed
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body should be valid json
    And response body should contain output_jwt
    And I store the value of body path $.output_jwt as outputToken in global scope
    
  Scenario: Verify Signed JWT
    Given I set form parameters to
      | parameter | value         |
      | JWT       | `outputToken` |
    When I POST to /verify-signed
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body should contain alg=RS256

  Scenario Outline: Generate Encrypted JWT
    When I POST to /generate-encrypted
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body should be valid json
    And response body should contain output_jwt
    And I store the value of body path $.output_jwt as outputToken in global scope
    
  Scenario: Verify Encrypted JWT
    Given I set form parameters to
      | parameter | value         |
      | JWT       | `outputToken` |
    When I POST to /verify-encrypted
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body should contain enc=A128GCM
